    1. "|":
        Arrow in float chart of script. If no "^" to indicate upward direction, script logic flows downwards.

        3 dots indicate further details of logic flow are stored in the script next to them. Due to the complicity of logic flows, it's impossible to draw them altogether. They are stored by pieces throughout the project.
